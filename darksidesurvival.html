<p>Still here huh? Good. You passed the test. Never back down. I see your future as a commander. You must rise to the test of time. Continue my child...</p>
<h2>
Dark Side Empathizer</h2>
<p>As a dark side empathizer, you must not reveal to people on the other side that you like the dark side. You can confide in stormtroopers, though.</p>
<h2>Stormtrooper</h2>
<p>
Wow!You were promoted already? Well, you better hurry, the rebel alliance will be more ambitious to get rid of you. Train harder than ever and stay safe! You can never put too much armor!
</p>
<h2>Squad Leader</h2>
<p>You are moving through the ranks fast! But now there is new dangers. You lead 5 stormtroopers and you are now a bigger target.</p>
<h2>Officer</h2>
<p>Now you command many troops and all of the drasted rebels hate you. You must now be cautious because if you fail, the jedis will kill you.</p>
<h2>
Admiral
</h2>
<p>
What! You are already an Admiral? How? Anyways, make sure to stay low and avoid huge areas of rebel influence. Make sure the jedis do not find you. You also own a Star Destroyer Now.
</p>
<h2>Sith Warrior</h2>
<p>You can only become a Sith if you shows signs of the force. You will be trained only by your master. If he deems you unworthy, you will die. To become the new master, you must kill your master to become the new one.</p>
